# About
Mindra (Mind Hydra) is an intelligent system designed to accelerate scientific innovation by automatically extracting, organizing, and generating research ideas. At its core, Mindra builds a structured knowledge base of research concepts by analyzing academic literature and related sources. This curated idea space enables researchers to explore prior work, discover emerging trends, and identify underexplored directions. In addition to idea mining, Mindra supports interactive research ideation: users can request fresh, relevant, and tailored research ideas generated based on the existing idea knowledge base. This makes Mindra a powerful tool for both early-stage brainstorming and strategic long-term planning in research. Whether you're a student seeking your next project or a seasoned researcher exploring new domains, Mindra aims to streamline the process of going from curiosity to contribution.
